# Plane Fitting Algorithm (RANSAC-like) for 3D Point Clouds in Processing Java

I couldn't find any plane-fitting algorithms for Processing, so I wrote my own.

Released under GPL-3.0-or-later.

There are two Processing sketches in this repo: one that fits a plane from the Kinect V2 point cloud using the KinectPV2 library, and one that fits a plane from a generated point cloud.

The algorithm is currently a RANSAC with a fixed number of iterations.

Enjoy!
